# CPP-OpenGL
The repository contains my work in OpenGL, from basic codes to animation and fun games using CPP data structures and OOP concepts.

All the codes are compatible with Windows. IF you want to use the codes in Linux/Mac, Please refer to files in "0_Extra_files" folder and replace the files in the required folder accordingly.



Some of the helper function files authored by Prof. Yamakawa Soji and Prof. Nestor Gomez.
